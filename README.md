# CODE DevOps Workshop
In this workshop we will:
 * Learn how to use AWS to launch and use compute resources in the Cloud
 * Run a Jenkins Continuous Integration server as a Docker container in the Cloud
 * Set up a CI Pipeline for a GitHub repository, so you can have automated Build, Test and Deploy, each time you commit!
## Pre-work
### What you will need
* A laptop with:
   * Git installed (www.git-scm.com/downloads)
   * A text editor of your choice (e.g. VS Code)
* An active AWS Educate account

### Register your AWS Educate Account
*Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a public cloud provider, that we will use to launch preconfigured instances for this workshop*
* Visit https://www.awseducate.com/Registration and register your Student account.
* Log in to AWS Educate account, click 'AWS Account' from the menu bar, click "Go to your AWS Educate starter account"
* This will launch a new window, with the AWS console

## Workshop
### Step 1: Launch your preconfigured Docker Host
* Log onto the AWS Console, go to Services > EC2
* Select "Launch Instance"
* Search for AMI id "<insert AMI ID here>", choose keypair called "devops-workshop" and security group called "devops-workshop"
* Launch the instance, take note of the public DNS of the instance

### Step 2: Connect to the instance using SSH
* Download the SSH key called code.pem from the dropbox @ <dropbox_link_here>
* From a Git Bash, SSH to instance with:
```
ssh ubuntu@<PUBLIC_DNS> -i /path/to/devops-workshop.pem
```

### Step 3: Run a Jenkins CI container
* Run following:
```
docker container run \
   --mount type=volume,source=jenkins-max-data,destination="/var/jenkins_home",volume-driver=local \
   -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
   -p 8080:8080 \
   --name jenkins-max -d \
   maxsteel/jenkins-code:latest
```
## Other Stuff
### Pseudocode
* Introduce App
* Show Dockerfile
* Show Jenkinsfile
    * Build
    * Test
    * Deploy (docker service update)
* Start AMI in AWS with Docker installed
* ssh to Instance and start jenkins service
* Log into Jenkins UI
* Add github repo
* Do initial build on master
* Make a code change on a new branch with TDD, submit a pull request, view build & test
* Merge PR, view build, test & deploy

### AMI config
* Install docker-ce
* set DOCKER_OPTS="--experimental=false" in /etc/default/docker
* usermod -aG docker ubuntu

### AWS IAM Profile permissions
* Create Key Pair
* Create Security Group
* Create AMI
* Create/launch/delete Instance
* Create/launch/delete ELB
